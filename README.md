# QML-HEP GSoC 2025 Tasks

## Overview
This repository contains my completed evaluation tasks for the QML-HEP GSoC 2025 selection process.Below is a summary of the completed tasks.

## Completed Tasks
I have completed the following tasks from the QML-HEP evaluation list:

- **Task I: Quantum Computing** – Implemented quantum circuits using Cirq and Pennylane, including Hadamard and CNOT operations, as well as a swap test.
- **Task II: Classical Graph Neural Network (GNN)** – Designed two graph-based architectures for quark/gluon jet classification and analyzed their performance.
- **Task III: Open Task** – Provided insights into quantum computing and quantum machine learning, discussing relevant algorithms and methods.
- **Task V: Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNN)** – Proposed a quantum graph neural network architecture and implemented a circuit leveraging the graph structure.
- **Task VI: Quantum Representation Learning** – Implemented a quantum representation learning scheme using contrastive loss with MNIST data.
- **Task VIII: Quantum Vision Transformer** – Built a classical Vision Transformer (ViT) and proposed a quantum version with a detailed sketch.
- **Task IX: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)** – Implemented a classical KAN and explored its quantum extension, providing an architectural design.

## Submission Instructions
The completed tasks are available in this public GitHub repository. I have ensured that all necessary code, explanations, and results are properly documented. If required, I can provide additional details regarding the implementation of specific tasks.

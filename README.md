# QML-HEP GSoC 2025 Tasks

## Overview
This repository contains my completed evaluation tasks for the QML-HEP GSoC 2025 selection process.Below is a summary of the completed tasks.

## Completed Tasks
I have completed the following tasks from the QML-HEP evaluation list:

- **Task I: Quantum Computing** – First question- Implement a simple quantum operation with Cirq or Pennylane
a) With 5 qubits 
b) Apply Hadamard operation on every qubit 
c) Apply CNOT operation on (0, 1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) 
d) SWAP (0, 4) 
e) Rotate X with pi/2 on any qubit 
f) Plot the circuit.
Second question-Implement a second circuit with a framework of your choice:
Apply a Hadmard gate to the first qubit
rotate the second qubit by pi/3 around X
Apply Hadamard gate to the third and fourth qubit
Perform a swap test between the states of the first and second qubit |q1 q2> and the third and fourth qubit |q3 q4>


- **Task II: Classical Graph Neural Network (GNN)** – Designed two classical graph-based architectures for quark/gluon jet classification and analyzed their performance.
- **Task III: Open Task** – Provided insights into quantum computing and quantum machine learning, discussing relevant algorithm, softwares and methods.
- **Task V: Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNN)** – Proposed quantum graph neural network architecture and implemented circuit leveraging the graph structure.
- **Task VI: Quantum Representation Learning** – Implemented a quantum representation learning scheme using contrastive loss with MNIST data.
- **Task VIII: Quantum Vision Transformer** – Built a classical Vision Transformer (ViT) and proposed a quantum version with a detailed sketch.
- **Task IX: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)** – Implemented a classical KAN and explored its quantum extension, providing an architectural design.

## Submission Instructions
The completed tasks are available in this public GitHub repository. I have ensured that all necessary code, explanations, and results are properly documented. If required, I can provide additional details regarding the implementation of specific tasks.
